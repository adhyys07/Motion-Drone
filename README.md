My Project Name is Motion-FPV-Drone. My drone consists has pentacopter design which has a center motor and four motor at the corners. This unique design helps the drone to get boost in vertical height and also assures safe landing if there is a error in any of corner motors , the center motor can help the drone to get a soft landing. The drone will be controlled by the Hand motion and can perform various stunts using the flex of fingers using the flex sensors.The drone also consists of camera which will cast the live footage on ground making the drone FPV !!! The drone will also consists of rechargable port in the drone itself to avoid detaching batteries and then charging which is a lot of hassle !
